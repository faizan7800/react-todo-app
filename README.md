# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application built using React. It allows users to manage their tasks, mark them as completed, and stores the todo list in `localStorage` to persist data between sessions.

## Features

1. **Add New Todos**: Users can add new tasks to the list using an input form.
2. **Toggle Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or incomplete by clicking on them.
3. **Persistent Storage**: Todo list is saved in the browser's `localStorage` so that tasks are retained after a page refresh or when reopening the application.
4. **Remove Tasks**: Ability to remove tasks from the list once completed.

## Usage

- Clone the repository and run the project using your preferred development environment.
- Add, complete, or remove tasks as needed, and your changes will be saved in `localStorage`.

## Requirements

- React version 16.8+
- Basic knowledge of `localStorage` for task persistence.
